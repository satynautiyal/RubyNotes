#----------Rails Engines----------------------#

	What are engines?
    ->	Engines can be considered miniature applications that provide functionality to their host applications. A Rails application is 		actually just a "supercharged" engine, with the Rails::Application class inheriting a lot of its behavior from Rails::Engine.

#---------------------------------------------Singleton class---------------------------------#
	Ruby provides a way to define methods that are specific to a particular object and such methods are known as Singleton Methods. 		When one declares a singleton method on an object, Ruby automatically creates a class to hold just the singleton methods. The newly 		created class is called Singleton Class.
